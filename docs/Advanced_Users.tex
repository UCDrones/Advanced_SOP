\chapter{Drone Guide Portal}\label{ch-getting-started}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/COE_logo} \end{center}

This is Standard Operating Procedures for Advanced UAS Operations. This manual is intended to promote safe and efficient UAS operations by any operator operating a UC-owned UAS or operating a personally owned UAS for University Business for non-standard UAS activity. This includes the use of UAS in moderate and above Risk Levels, the use of UAS in conjunction with a UC Airspace Waiver or Operational Waiver.

Further information regarding the operation of UAS may be found within the Presidential Unmanned Aircraft System Policy and/or the \href{https://ucdrones.github.io/Policy_Guidance/}{UAS Policy Guidance Document}.

This page will be a work in progress and new resources will be added periodically. Feel free to reach out to us at \href{mailto:UASSafety@ucmerced.edu}{\nolinkurl{UASSafety@ucmerced.edu}} if you have any questions or would like to see additional resources added.

\chapter{Scope}\label{ch-scope}

The Standard Operating Procedures for Advanced UAS Operations (SOPA) has been prepared for the use and guidance of UAS in flight operations, flight planning, training, and oversight as a requirement to exercise the privileges of operating under 1) a Grant of Exemption pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, 2) any Public Agency Operation when operating a Public Aircraft, 3) any other operations conducted under a Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA) including an Airspace Authorization, Airspace Waiver or Operational Waiver or 4) any operation categorized as a moderate and above Risk Level.

\begin{quote}
The SOPA does not address every possible contingency that may arise or every rule of safety and good practice. In addition to the SOPA, operators of UAS are expected to be aware of their surroundings and take into account any special characteristics of the area or the mission being flown.
\end{quote}

All faculty, staff, students, and other personnel operating under the privileges of the UC's Grant of Exemption, and any COAs, must be in compliance with all applicable Federal Aviation Regulations, and State and local laws. To the extent of any inconsistencies between the minimum requirements set in the UC UAS Policy, the Policy Guidance Document, or the SOPA and any applicable regulation, the regulatory requirements govern.

\begin{quote}
The SOPA must be read in conjunction with the UC's Grant of Exemption and any applicable COA issued to the UC by the FAA. Copies of these documents should be included as an Appendix to the SOPA before conducting UAS activity. The SOPA, including any revised documents, must be made available to the FAA upon request. To download a copy of this SOPA, click the download options (PDF, ePUB) in the header bar.
\end{quote}

The SOPA is intended to be a convenient source of the UC's advanced or non-standard UAS operation procedures. Everyone participating in applicable UAS activity should study this entire Manual to familiarize themselves with its requirements before participating in any UAS activity for University business.

Always remember -- everyone operating a UAS under the University's banner shares responsibility for compliance and ensuring safety.
Good luck and fly safely!

The following section outlines the Flight Planning Procedures for UAS activity operating under 1) Grant of Exemption pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, 2) any Public Agency Operation when operating a Public Aircraft, 3) any other operations conducted under a COA including an Airspace Authorization, Airspace Waiver or Operational Waiver, or 4) any operation categorized as a moderate and above Risk Level. The procedures below do not apply to UAS activity in uncontrolled airspace scored as minor or low Risk Level.

\section{General}\label{general}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A Normal UAS activity is any flight that is not conducted for training or maintenance purposes.
\item
  All UAS activity are limited to speeds at or below the amount specified in the applicable Grant of Exemption, COA,Operational Waiver, regulations as specified within 14 CFR 107, or as described within the Manufacturer's Manual.
\item
  All UAS activity are limited to altitudes at or below the amount specified in the applicable Grant of Exemption, COA,Operational Waiver, regulations as specified within 14 CFR 107, or as described within the Manufacturer's Manual.
\item
  The RPIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough power for the unmanned aircraft to conduct the intended operation and to operate with sufficient reserve power as recommended by the manufacturer.
\item
  Per Policy, all UAS activity requires prior approval granted via the submission of a UAS Activity Request Form.
\item
  It is the responsibility of the RPIC to evaluate each UAS activity in detail prior to operation.
\item
  The Systemwide Designated UAS Authority or Designated Local Authority will evaluate a UAS Activity Request Form for regulatory compliance, identify campus coordination requirements or other requirements necessary to enable UAS activity.
\end{itemize}

\section{Flight Request}\label{flight-request}

Per Policy, all UAS activity requires prior approval granted via the submission of a UAS Activity Request Form. A UAS Activity Request Form must contain all pertinent information to evaluate compliance with Policy. Upon submission of a UAS Activity Request Form, a flight request may be scored with a Risk Level by the Systemwide Designated UAS Authority or Designated Local Authority.

For UAS activity with a Risk Level of moderate and above, additional documentation and analysis is necessary. A satisfactory UAS Activity Request Form must contain the following information:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Date and times of flights
\item
  Purpose of the flights
\item
  Name(s) and certificate number(s) of the RPIC(s).
\item
  Registration of the unmanned aircraft to be flown
\item
  Name of the Point of Contact or Project Manager
\item
  Expected field time
\item
  GPS coordinates of the flight area
\item

\item
  Max flight distance (away from the RPIC)
\item
  Max flight altitude
\item
  Project specific conditions (Flight over people, near buildings, at night, etc)
\item
  A Site Assessment or description of hazards and hazard mitigation plan
\item
  A copy of a Field Safety Plan (if off-campus), including documentation on contact information for local first responders.
\end{itemize}

All documentation, including the UAS Activity Request Form must be accessible either electronically or with a hard-copy by the RPIC during UAS activity.

\chapter{Flight Safety Guidelines}\label{ch-flight-safety}

All UAS activity must develop a comprehensive flight safety plan.

\section{Site Assessment}\label{site-assessment}

UAS safety typically falls under two categories: (1) Planned Safety and (2) On-site threats. The UAS activity review process includes a review of Planned Safety to ensure that the RPIC is aware of potential risks and has procedures to mitigate risks.

Not all potential safety considerations may be applicable. Many risks associated with UAS activity can be mitigated by selecting operating locations where a UAS incident or accident would be unlikely to cause an injury.

\subsection{Planned Safety}\label{planned-safety}

The RPIC must plan for the safety of the UAS activity by evaluating to the best of his or her ability, the following potential impacts:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Type of airspace, restricted flight areas
\item
  Any applicable Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) or NOTAM
\item
  Hazards associated with the location, such as roadways, powerlines, towers
\item
  Local laws or ordinances
\item
  Obstructions (wires, structures, buildings, etc)
\item
  Pedestrian or bicycle pathways, public access and access points (common doorways or entrances)
\item
  Identifying alternative emergency contingency or recovery sites
\item
  Weather conditions by consulting with weather forecasts online
\end{itemize}

After evaluating the site, the RPIC is responsible for developing a suitable flight plan and hazard mitigation plan (as appropriate).

The following information is expected within a Site Assessment or description of hazards and hazard mitigation plan as submitted with a UAS Activity Request Form:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Narrative of the proposed operation
\item
  Flight altitudes
\item
  Marking of buffer or safe-zones
\item
  Specific flight paths
\item
  Emergency procedures
\item
  Identified emergency or contingency locations
\item
  Crew management (including roles and responsibilities)
\item
  Procedures to manage crowds or spectators
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Mission_Planning_UCSB} 

}

\caption{Mapping out helpers at UCSB}\label{fig:MP-UCSB}
\end{figure}

\subsection{On-site Threats}\label{on-site-threats}

There are many on-site threats to UAS safety that are not always feasible to be reviewed. It is the responsibility of the RPIC to ensure a safe operating environment, from ensuring the unmanned aircraft is suitable for operation to managing intrusions and weather conditions.

\textbf{Example On-site Threats}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Weather conditions
\item
  Structures not visible from satellite imagery, such as

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Powerlines or telephone poles
  \item
    Recent construction
  \item
    Temporary structures
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Intruding air traffic
\item
  Intruding pedestrians or other non-participants, including wildlife
\item
  unmanned aircraft damage
\item
  Unplanned spectators or crowds
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Weather}\label{weather}

Local weather must be checked prior to UAS activity to ensure wind speeds, precipitation, temperature or other environmental factors will not adversely affect the safety of the UAS activity. This information should then be re-checked during the on-site survey, prior to take-off. No UAS activity shall occur when weather conditions exceed VFR Weather minimums or the listed aircraft tolerance per the manufacturer's manual.

\subsection{Site Permissions}\label{site-permissions}

All UAS activity at a University Location must have prior authorization, accomplished via the UAS Activity Request Form. If additional authorization is required by a managing entity (campus recreation, Natural Reserve Site Director), it shall be obtained in coordination with the Designated Local Authority or Systemwide Designated UAS Authority. At off-site locations, site permissions shall be obtained as necessary. The UC shall maintain good neighbor relations with all public entities and shall abide by the processes or restrictions as directed.

\textbf{Common Public Land}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  California State Parks - contact the Park Director
\item
  Other California State Agency Land - contact the site director
\item
  National Forest (excluding Wilderness Lands) - No authorization necessary
\end{itemize}

For UAS activity, the RPIC shall obtain site permission to the best of his or her ability for all property the UAS activity will occur above.

\section{Safety Guidelines}\label{safety-guidelines}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  UAS activity should always establish a buffer or safe-zone between the unmanned aircraft and any non-participating persons or sensitive locations.\\
\item
  A good rule-of-thumb is to maintain a buffer or safe-zone of roughly \(\frac{1}{4}^{th}\) of the flight altitude.\\
\item
  Visual Observers and supporting ground crew should be utilized when available.
\item
  Supporting ground crew should assist in ensuring safety to all non-participating persons.
\item
  High visibility reflective vests should be utilized when operating near roads or when near non-participants (Figure \ref{fig:UASvests}).
\item
  Whistles are effective for alerts or other time-sensitive communication.
\item
  Orange cones may be used to help communicate unmanned aircraft flight regions to non-participating persons, but are not fully sufficient.
\item
  If spectators are expected, a supporting ground crew member should be tasked with preventing spectators from distracting the RPIC with questions or comments.
\item
  When operating in uncontrolled locations in proximity to non-participating persons, extra care should be exercised. Specific flight paths and altitudes should be pre-planned such that potential gaps in buffer or safe-zones can be identified.
\item
  When operating near roads, a supporting ground crew member should be tasked with being located near the road to monitor traffic, and if necessary, retrieve a fallen unmanned aircraft before it becomes a road hazard.
\item
  When operating in fenced areas, operate exclusively within the fenced areas unless there is sufficient visibility on the other side to ensure safety to non-participants.
\item
  Flying above buildings and structures minimizes risk to pedestrians, but it is recommended to contact the facility manager to explain the proposed operation and potential for risk.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Crew Coordination Standards}\label{ch-crm}

\section{Crew Participant Minimum}\label{crew-participant-minimum}

A member of the Flight Crew must be actively involved in the safety of the UAS activity - this includes participation in pre-flight activities such as planning and briefing, have a well-defined role during the UAS activity and post-flight cleanup. A spectator or spectator crowd may not be `deputized' to a crew member status to circumvent FAA regulations regarding flight operations over people.

\section{Pre-Flight Briefing}\label{pfb}

Briefing is an essential part of conducting UAS activity in a safe and efficient manner. On the day of the flight, prior to the start of UAS activity, the RPIC shall brief all Flight Personnel on the goals, objectives and key safety considerations of the planned UAS activity. The intent is to cover all operation aspects of the UAS activity and to promote full understanding among all Flight Personnel. The guidelines for conducting Flight Personnel briefings are listing below. At a minimum, the RPIC must cover the following in a briefing:

\chapter{Emergency Operations}\label{emergency-operations}

The recommended procedures for addressing various types of emergencies and critical situations are provided by this Section and in the Manufacturer's Manual. These procedures are suggested as the best practice for coping with the particular conditions described, but are not a substitute for sound judgment and common sense. All personnel, including the RPIC, VO(s) and all Ground Crew engaged in UAS activity under this SOPA should familiarize themselves with the general procedures given in this Section and the Manufacturer's Manual and be prepared to take appropriate action should an emergency arise.

\section{General Emergency Planning}\label{general-emergency-planning}

It is required that all UAS activity under this SOPA have a completed emergency procedure plan. A template can be found in \href{https://ucdrones.github.io/ch-resources.html}{UC Drone Resources}.

\textbf{Required Emergency Plans}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Non-participating person incursion in flight area
\item
  Hazardous Weather Conditions
\item
  Low Battery or UAS Status Issue
\item
  COllision with Hazard
\item
  Fly Away or Loss of GPS
\item
  Lost link or C2 link failure
\item
  In-Flight or Post-Flight Fire
\item
  Pilot Incapacitation
\item
  Manned Aircraft Encroachment in flight area
\end{itemize}

All operations require the RPIC to designate a lost link/emergency termination zones prior to UAS activity. The RPIC retains the right to change or modify that selection if potentially unsafe conditions exist. These zones may be the same location or different locations, depending on the needs of the mission.

The RPIC shall take all necessary actions to ensure that the launch and recover of the unmanned aircraft does not present a hazard to persons and property on the ground. The RPIC, VO and any Ground Crew will take all reasonable actions to ensure all non-essential personnel and nonparticipating persons remain at least 10 feet laterally away from landing zones, including emergency landing zones, while the unmanned aircraft is taking off or landing.

\section{General Emergency Procedures}\label{general-emergency-procedures}

The RPIC is responsible for ensuring flight safety and is responsible for making any assessment in regards to flight safety. If the RPIC is incapacitated for any reason, the responsibility goes to the Visual Observer, unless an alternate has been selected.

In an emergency situation involving the safety of persons or property, which requires immediate decisions and actions, the RPIC or any other appropriate Ground Crew member may take action that is considered necessary under the circumstances to ensure safety.

If, for any reason, the UAS needs to conduct an emergency landing, flight crew personnel, such as the VO or other supporting ground crew will take actions to immediately warn people on the ground below where the unmanned aircraft is operating and alert the RPIC of any potential hazards so that the RPIC can take appropriate action to ensure safe operations of the flight. They must also immediately warn people on the ground below where the unmanned aircraft is operating of any potential hazards associated with the UAS activity.

\begin{quote}
The RPIC may deviate from prescribed operations procedures and methods, weather minimums, regulations, this Manual, etc., to the extent necessary, in the interest of safety.
\end{quote}

A member of the Flight Crew, typically the Visual Observer, shall keep the appropriate ATC facilities fully informed when an in-flight UAS emergency could potentially impact operations of aircraft in navigable air space.

\chapter{Accident Response}\label{accident-response}

All UAS incidents and accidents must be reported. For minor incidents, this may be done through the normal UAS post-flight reporting system through UC Drones.

For all incidents that result in injury, or property damage of any amount, the Campus Designated Local Authority or the Systemwide Designated UAS Authority must be contacted immediately.

\section{Emergency Contact Information}\label{emergency-contact-information}

The emergency contact information for the Systemwide Designated UAS Authority and the Campus Designated Local Authority must be included on the Emergency Procedure Plan and included in the UAS Mission Binder.

\textbf{Systemwide Designated UAS Authority}

\begin{verbatim}
Dr. Brandon Stark
Director, UC Center of Excellence on UAS Safety
(209) 201-2051
UASsafety@ucmerced.edu
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Designated Local Authority}

See \href{https://ucdrones.github.io/ch-DLA.html}{Campus Points of Contact} for the contact information for each of the UC campuses.

\section{Document an accident}\label{document-an-accident}

As soon as it is safe to,

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Write down a narrative about the incident. Describe what you remember and with as much detail as possible.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Take note of anything out of the ordinary
  \item
    Include any information that might be relevant for understanding how the incident occured
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Preserve the scene digitally by taking photos and videos
\end{itemize}

\textbf{No one is punished or penalized for reporting an incident or accident. Retribution is not the purpose of documentation. All documentation collected will be used to help improve future practices.}

\chapter{Fire Safety}\label{fire-safety}

While UAS accidents and incidents involving fire are rare, they are a valid and significant concern. With the majority of UC UAS usage on field sites and other rural locations, the potential for the accidental sparking of fire is a concern. A fire sparked by a UAS can spread quickly (Figure \ref{fig:fire-start}) and with California's dry environment, can cause significant damage (Figure \ref{fig:fire-damage}).

\begin{figure}

}

\caption{Post fire damage from UAS accident at Richmond Field Station, UC Berkeley}\label{fig:fire-damage}
\end{figure}

\section{LiPo Battery Guidance}\label{lipo-battery-guidance}

The most common cause of UAS related fire is from misuse of LiPo batteries. Special care should be taken when charging, discharging or storing LiPo batteries. If the internal polymer cell of a LiPo battery is exposed to air, a violent chemical reaction starts that could explode, but more commonly releases significant amounts of smoke and heat that can ignite other fire fuel sources. A LiPo battery fire is typically caused by a physical puncture to the battery or from misuse, such as overcharging or electrical shorts.

\textbf{Recommended Best Practices}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Always thoroughly inspect a battery before charging and use.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Look for swelling, puffy cells, cracks in plastic, and charred debris along the contacts.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Never use a battery that is not in good health.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Consider batteries to be replaceable and consumable, rather than a permanent component of the UAS.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Never store batteries in a hot car.
\item
  Don't charge your batteries unless you're going to fly within the next day.
\item
  After immediate use, place battery out of the sun but do not place within a closed container.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Ensure there is sufficient airflow to allow the battery to cool.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  When done flying for the day, always charge your batteries at least back up to storage level.
\item
  Do not charge an intelligent flight battery immediately after flight as the temperature may be too high. Wait until it cools down to room temperature before charging again.
\item
  Store the battery in a dry and cool place, keep out of direct sunlight and away from any liquids
\item
  Do not store or transport a battery with eyeglasses, watches, metal necklaces or other metal components that may short the battery
\item
  When in transport, store the batteries in a safe container that will protect it from damage, squeezing, puncturing or falling.
\end{itemize}

\section{Planning for Fire Mitigation}\label{planning-for-fire-mitigation}

In addition to LiPo battery care, special effort must be taken to consider the fire risks in UAS activity. Consult the appropriate department (Fire, Field Safety, EH\&S) if there are concerns over fire risk. Minimize the potential for fire by monitoring where the UAS will be flying and ensure that if a fire was to occur, the RPIC and any other persons, such as Visual Observers, are prepared to respond appropriately.

\textbf{Guidance for fire safety}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Everyone should take a fire safety training course.
\item
  Avoid flying on high fire risk days, including \href{https://www.fire.ca.gov/programs/communications/red-flag-warnings-fire-weather-watches/}{Red Flag Warning} alerts issued by CAL FIRE.
\item
  Never fly alone in areas of moderate to high fire risk
\item
  Always bring a fire extinguisher and a shovel/bucket of sand to field sites.
\item
  During flight operations:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Ensure that a crew member has easy access to fire equipment.
  \item
    Ensure that a crew member has easy access to reach any location where the unmanned aircraft may crash.
  \item
    Ensure that a crew member has the ability to report an emergency situation and can adequately provide directions for emergency personnel to reach the site.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  When flying in high fire risk locations, use high quality, commercially available unmanned aircraft with enclosed electronics.
\item
  Never fly a damaged or swollen battery.
\end{itemize}
