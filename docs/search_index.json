The procedures below do not apply to UAS activity in uncontrolled airspace scored as minor or low Risk Level. 6.1 General A Normal UAS activity is any flight that is not conducted for training or maintenance purposes. All UAS activity are limited to speeds at or below the amount specified in the applicable Grant of Exemption, COA,Operational Waiver, regulations as specified within 14 CFR 107, or as described within the Manufacturer’s Manual. All UAS activity are limited to altitudes at or below the amount specified in the applicable Grant of Exemption, COA,Operational Waiver, regulations as specified within 14 CFR 107, or as described within the Manufacturer’s Manual. The RPIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough power for the unmanned aircraft to conduct the intended operation and to operate with sufficient reserve power as recommended by the manufacturer. Per Policy, all UAS activity requires prior approval granted via the submission of a UAS Activity Request Form. It is the responsibility of the RPIC to evaluate each UAS activity in detail prior to operation. The Systemwide Designated UAS Authority or Designated Local Authority will evaluate a UAS Activity Request Form for regulatory compliance, identify campus coordination requirements or other requirements necessary to enable UAS activity. 6.2 Flight Request Per Policy, all UAS activity requires prior approval granted via the submission of a UAS Activity Request Form. A UAS Activity Request Form must contain all pertinent information to evaluate compliance with Policy. Upon submission of a UAS Activity Request Form, a flight request may be scored with a Risk Level by the Systemwide Designated UAS Authority or Designated Local Authority. For UAS activity with a Risk Level of moderate and above, additional documentation and analysis is necessary. A satisfactory UAS Activity Request Form must contain the following information: Date and times of flights Purpose of the flights Name(s) and certificate number(s) of the RPIC(s). Registration of the unmanned aircraft to be flown Name of the Point of Contact or Project Manager Expected field time GPS coordinates of the flight area Planned flight trajectories (as appropriate) Max flight distance (away from the RPIC) Max flight altitude Project specific conditions (Flight over people, near buildings, at night, etc) A Site Assessment or description of hazards and hazard mitigation plan A copy of a Field Safety Plan (if off-campus), including documentation on contact information for local first responders. All documentation, including the UAS Activity Request Form must be accessible either electronically or with a hard-copy by the RPIC during UAS activity. "],["ch-flight-safety.html", "Chapter 7 Flight Safety Guidelines 7.1 Site Assessment 7.2 Safety Guidelines", " Chapter 7 Flight Safety Guidelines All UAS activity must develop a comprehensive flight safety plan. 7.1 Site Assessment UAS safety typically falls under two categories: (1) Planned Safety and (2) On-site threats. The UAS activity review process includes a review of Planned Safety to ensure that the RPIC is aware of potential risks and has procedures to mitigate risks. Not all potential safety considerations may be applicable. Many risks associated with UAS activity can be mitigated by selecting operating locations where a UAS incident or accident would be unlikely to cause an injury. 7.1.1 Planned Safety The RPIC must plan for the safety of the UAS activity by evaluating to the best of his or her ability, the following potential impacts: Type of airspace, restricted flight areas Any applicable Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) or NOTAM Hazards associated with the location, such as roadways, powerlines, towers Local laws or ordinances Obstructions (wires, structures, buildings, etc) Pedestrian or bicycle pathways, public access and access points (common doorways or entrances) Identifying alternative emergency contingency or recovery sites Weather conditions by consulting with weather forecasts online After evaluating the site, the RPIC is responsible for developing a suitable flight plan and hazard mitigation plan (as appropriate). The following information is expected within a Site Assessment or description of hazards and hazard mitigation plan as submitted with a UAS Activity Request Form: Narrative of the proposed operation Flight altitudes Marking of buffer or safe-zones Specific flight paths Emergency procedures Identified emergency or contingency locations Crew management (including roles and responsibilities) Procedures to manage crowds or spectators Figure 7.1: Mapping out helpers at UCSB 7.1.2 On-site Threats There are many on-site threats to UAS safety that are not always feasible to be reviewed. It is the responsibility of the RPIC to ensure a safe operating environment, from ensuring the unmanned aircraft is suitable for operation to managing intrusions and weather conditions. Example On-site Threats Weather conditions Structures not visible from satellite imagery, such as Powerlines or telephone poles Recent construction Temporary structures Intruding air traffic Intruding pedestrians or other non-participants, including wildlife unmanned aircraft damage Unplanned spectators or crowds 7.1.3 Weather Local weather must be checked prior to UAS activity to ensure wind speeds, precipitation, temperature or other environmental factors will not adversely affect the safety of the UAS activity. This information should then be re-checked during the on-site survey, prior to take-off. No UAS activity shall occur when weather conditions exceed VFR Weather minimums or the listed aircraft tolerance per the manufacturer’s manual. 7.1.4 Site Permissions All UAS activity at a University Location must have prior authorization, accomplished via the UAS Activity Request Form. If additional authorization is required by a managing entity (campus recreation, Natural Reserve Site Director), it shall be obtained in coordination with the Designated Local Authority or Systemwide Designated UAS Authority. At off-site locations, site permissions shall be obtained as necessary. The UC shall maintain good neighbor relations with all public entities and shall abide by the processes or restrictions as directed. Common Public Land California State Parks - contact the Park Director Other California State Agency Land - contact the site director National Forest (excluding Wilderness Lands) - No authorization necessary For UAS activity, the RPIC shall obtain site permission to the best of his or her ability for all property the UAS activity will occur above. 7.2 Safety Guidelines UAS activity should always establish a buffer or safe-zone between the unmanned aircraft and any non-participating persons or sensitive locations. A good rule-of-thumb is to maintain a buffer or safe-zone of roughly \\(\\frac{1}{4}^{th}\\) of the flight altitude. Visual Observers and supporting ground crew should be utilized when available. Supporting ground crew should assist in ensuring safety to all non-participating persons. High visibility reflective vests should be utilized when operating near roads or when near non-participants (Figure 7.2). Whistles are effective for alerts or other time-sensitive communication. Orange cones may be used to help communicate unmanned aircraft flight regions to non-participating persons, but are not fully sufficient. If spectators are expected, a supporting ground crew member should be tasked with preventing spectators from distracting the RPIC with questions or comments. When operating in uncontrolled locations in proximity to non-participating persons, extra care should be exercised. Specific flight paths and altitudes should be pre-planned such that potential gaps in buffer or safe-zones can be identified. When operating near roads, a supporting ground crew member should be tasked with being located near the road to monitor traffic, and if necessary, retrieve a fallen unmanned aircraft before it becomes a road hazard. When operating in fenced areas, operate exclusively within the fenced areas unless there is sufficient visibility on the other side to ensure safety to non-participants. Flying above buildings and structures minimizes risk to pedestrians, but it is recommended to contact the facility manager to explain the proposed operation and potential for risk.

A spectator or spectator crowd may not be ‘deputized’ to a crew member status to circumvent FAA regulations regarding flight operations over people. 8.2 Pre-Flight Briefing Briefing is an essential part of conducting UAS activity in a safe and efficient manner. On the day of the flight, prior to the start of UAS activity, the RPIC shall brief all Flight Personnel on the goals, objectives and key safety considerations of the planned UAS activity. The intent is to cover all operation aspects of the UAS activity and to promote full understanding among all Flight Personnel. The guidelines for conducting Flight Personnel briefings are listing below. At a minimum, the RPIC must cover the following in a briefing: General Information about the Flight Type of Flight (training, maintenance, normal) UAS Status - condition, recent maintenance, fuel or battery state Any mission issues the ground crew should be aware of? Crew Members &amp; their roles and responsibilities. List out by each of the flight phases: Before launch During flight In case of an emergency After landing Mission Information Primary mission goals, any secondary goals Flight Path Detail - estimated duration, flight altitude, flight pattern Landing &amp; Recovery Procedures Site Description and Hazard Analysis Hazards and Risks Boundaries Areas of Concern Non-participating Persons Nearby airports or areas of air traffic Weather Current forecast Weather forecast for the duration of the flight activity Potential weather conditions to monitor Communication Procedures Chain of command Communication phrasebook Mission or Flight Stop/Pause Conditions Go/No-Go Conditions (in-flight) Mission Stop Checks (at what conditions should the overall mission be stopped) Flight Stop Checks (at what conditions should an individual flight be stopped) Flight Pause Checks (at what conditions should an individual flight be paused) Emergency Management - Roles and Responsibilities during the following situations: Non-participating person incursion in flight area Hazardous Weather Conditions Low Battery or UAS Status Issue COllision with Hazard Fly Away or Loss of GPS Lost link or C2 link failure In-Flight or Post-Flight Fire Pilot Incapacitation Manned Aircraft Encroachment in flight area Remind the entire crew of the Sterile Cockpit Requirement Public safety should be addressed at every briefing to mitigate all risks from UC flight operations. 8.3 Flight Team Member Positioning The following factors should be considered when positioning the Flight Team members: Visual coverage of the operating site Position in relation to the sun to avoid visual impairment Physical obstacles such as overhanging trees, rocks, buildings, power lines etc. Terrain topography, avoid steep slopes or uneven ground Effects such as wind shear from nearby trees, buildings etc Proximity to buildings and structures Figure 8.1: Planning for Safety at UC Berkeley 8.4 Sterile Cockpit Requirement After the pre-flight briefing and until the completion of the final cleanup, the RPIC, all Visual Observers and all Ground Support Personnel are prohibited from engaging in non-essential duties or activities. Example failures seen within the UC System: RPIC became distracted while talking with a student and did not recognize that the unmanned aircraft was on a collision course with a floodlight. An Ground Support Personnel was engaged in conversation and did not adequately check the unmanned aircraft for loose linkages in between flights, leading to an in-flight failure of the elevator. The RPIC was interrupted by a curious bystander. Extraneous conversation led to forgetting of the detachable wings of a fixed-wing unmanned aircraft at the lab.

For other Standard Operating Procedures, please see the New User Guide. A Normal UAS activity is any flight that is not conducted for training or maintenance purposes. Per Policy, all UAS activity requires prior approval granted via the submission of a UAS Activity Request Form. It is the responsibility of the RPIC to evaluate each UAS activity in detail prior to operation. The Systemwide Designated UAS Authority or Designated Local Authority will evaluate a UAS Activity Request Form for regulatory compliance, identify campus coordination requirements or other requirements necessary to enable UAS activity. 9.1 Operational Requirements Before any UAS activity is conducted under the provisions of this SOPA, the RPIC will obtain permission to conduct these operations from all necessary parties. In addition to UC approval, approval may be necessary from property owners and/or local officials as necessary or appropriate. All operations may only be conducted over property where permission has been granted from the owner/ controller or authorized representative. No UAS activity may occur under the provisions of this SOPA without a completed UAS Mission Binder A visual observer is mandatory for all operations under this SOPA. 9.2 Pre-Flight Procedures Upon preparing for flight operations, the RPIC is responsible for ensuring that all the necessary information from the completed UAS Mission Binder is available to all flight crew. Emergency contact numbers and instructions must be Any necessary outstanding mission documentation must be completed prior to flight operations All safety equipment, including fire extinguishers must be setup and ready to deploy The RPIC must conduct a Pre-Flight Briefing prior to flight operations A Pre-Flight Check is mandatory prior to each flight. 9.2.1 Pre-Flight Checklist Requirements A Pre-Flight Checklist must have, at a minimum, the following checks: Inspecting the UAS to ensure it is in a condition for safe flight. The UAS must have sufficient fuel or battery capacity to conduct the operation and with a sufficient reserver The Ground Control Station and any other supplemental equipment such as tablets and landing pads, if used, must be included in the Pre-Flight inspection. All payload equipment, including lens and memory cards, is ready for operation Evaluating the current conditions of the flight operational area Evaluating the current and future weather conditions Verifying the flight crew is aware of and capable of conducting their role in a satisfactory manner and are in position. Ensuring the airspace and operational area is appropriately clear and safe to operate within 9.3 Flight Operations All Flight Personnel must remain at his or her station as listed in the Flight Operation Plan during takeoff, landing, recovery, and other critical phases of flight, except when performing those duties required for the safe operation of the aircraft. The RPIC must ensure that the unmanned aircraft maintains a sufficient power reserve as recommended by the manufacturer. The RPIC must terminate the flight and land the unmanned aircraft at any time it appears that the required battery reserves cannot be maintained. When terminating a flight, the primary concern must be the safety of nonparticipating persons. All flight operations must be done in accordance to the prepared flight plan and as described during the pre-flight briefing. Intentional deviations are prohibited. If a deviation is desired, terminate the flight and prepare a new flight plan. 9.4 Payload Manipulation If it has been determined that the mission can be safely flown without a separate Payload Operator, the RPIC may not adjust or manipulate the payload in any way unless the aircraft is in a GPS-assisted or autonomous flight mode where there is no danger of collision or loss of control. Payload manipulation or adjustment activities must be coordinated with the Visual Observer to ensure adequacy of see-and-avoid procedures and minimum safe distance requirements. 9.5 Recovery All UAS landing and recovery will be accomplished in accordance with the Manufacturer’s Manual. The UAS landing and recovery will take place at the pre-designated landing zone. A designated landing zone must be as safe and secure as possible. To the extent possible, the zone should be free of any any obstacles or hazards, including but not limited to: Trees or tall brush Fences Large rocks Towers Poles Overhead wires Dust and small pieces of debris Ground vehicles Other aircraft Where deemed necessary, Ground Support Personnel will take necessary actions to advise all non-participants to remain a safe distance (typically 10 ft) away laterally away from the landing zone while the unmanned aircraft is landing. When possible, locate landing zones such that recovery can be made into the prevailing winds. 9.6 Shutdown/Post-Flight UAS shutdown and post flight actions will be taken in accordance with the Manufacturer’s Manual. The RPIC must complete a post-flight summary using a Post Flight Form. The summary must include, but not be limited to: Date Location of Operation (including latitude/longitude) Name(s) and certificate number(s) of the RPIC(s). Registration of the unmanned aircraft to be flown Name of the Point of Contact or Project Manager The names of all flight crew including Visual Observer, Payload Operator or Ground Support Personnel. Duration of Operation Any issues encountered during the operation, including launch or landing damages, lost link, malfunctions, near-misses or other safety issues. In the event of an non-emergency safety incident, the RPIC should document the incident and attach all relevant information with the Post Flight Form. Each lost-link event that occurs during the UAS activity, must be documented in the Post Flight Form. The RPIC or a properly trained Visual Observer or Ground Support Personnel must conduct a post flight aircraft inspection as recommended in the Manufacturer’s Manual. "],["emergency-operations.html", "Chapter 10 Emergency Operations 10.1 General Emergency Planning 10.2 General Emergency Procedures", " Chapter 10 Emergency Operations The recommended procedures for addressing various types of emergencies and critical situations are provided by this Section and in the Manufacturer’s Manual. These procedures are suggested as the best practice for coping with the particular conditions described, but are not a substitute for sound judgment and common sense. All personnel, including the RPIC, VO(s) and all Ground Crew engaged in UAS activity under this SOPA should familiarize themselves with the general procedures given in this Section and the Manufacturer’s Manual and be prepared to take appropriate action should an emergency arise. 10.1 General Emergency Planning It is required that all UAS activity under this SOPA have a completed emergency procedure plan. A template can be found in UC Drone Resources. Required Emergency Plans Non-participating person incursion in flight area Hazardous Weather Conditions Low Battery or UAS Status Issue COllision with Hazard Fly Away or Loss of GPS Lost link or C2 link failure In-Flight or Post-Flight Fire Pilot Incapacitation Manned Aircraft Encroachment in flight area All operations require the RPIC to designate a lost link/emergency termination zones prior to UAS activity. The RPIC retains the right to change or modify that selection if potentially unsafe conditions exist. These zones may be the same location or different locations, depending on the needs of the mission. The RPIC shall take all necessary actions to ensure that the launch and recover of the unmanned aircraft does not present a hazard to persons and property on the ground. The RPIC, VO and any Ground Crew will take all reasonable actions to ensure all non-essential personnel and nonparticipating persons remain at least 10 feet laterally away from landing zones, including emergency landing zones, while the unmanned aircraft is taking off or landing. 10.2 General Emergency Procedures The RPIC is responsible for ensuring flight safety and is responsible for making any assessment in regards to flight safety. If the RPIC is incapacitated for any reason, the responsibility goes to the Visual Observer, unless an alternate has been selected. In an emergency situation involving the safety of persons or property, which requires immediate decisions and actions, the RPIC or any other appropriate Ground Crew member may take action that is considered necessary under the circumstances to ensure safety. If, for any reason, the UAS needs to conduct an emergency landing, flight crew personnel, such as the VO or other supporting ground crew will take actions to immediately warn people on the ground below where the unmanned aircraft is operating and alert the RPIC of any potential hazards so that the RPIC can take appropriate action to ensure safe operations of the flight. They must also immediately warn people on the ground below where the unmanned aircraft is operating of any potential hazards associated with the UAS activity. The RPIC may deviate from prescribed operations procedures and methods, weather minimums, regulations, this Manual, etc., to the extent necessary, in the interest of safety. A member of the Flight Crew, typically the Visual Observer, shall keep the appropriate ATC facilities fully informed when an in-flight UAS emergency could potentially impact operations of aircraft in navigable air space.

"],["fire-safety.html", "Chapter 12 Fire Safety 12.1 LiPo Battery Guidance 12.2 Planning for Fire Mitigation", " Chapter 12 Fire Safety While UAS accidents and incidents involving fire are rare, they are a valid and significant concern. With the majority of UC UAS usage on field sites and other rural locations, the potential for the accidental sparking of fire is a concern. A fire sparked by a UAS can spread quickly (Figure 12.1) and with California’s dry environment, can cause significant damage (Figure 12.2). Figure 12.1: Beginning of a fire from UAS accident at Richmond Field Station, UC Berkeley Figure 12.2: Post fire damage from UAS accident at Richmond Field Station, UC Berkeley 12.1 LiPo Battery Guidance The most common cause of UAS related fire is from misuse of LiPo batteries. Special care should be taken when charging, discharging or storing LiPo batteries. If the internal polymer cell of a LiPo battery is exposed to air, a violent chemical reaction starts that could explode, but more commonly releases significant amounts of smoke and heat that can ignite other fire fuel sources. A LiPo battery fire is typically caused by a physical puncture to the battery or from misuse, such as overcharging or electrical shorts. Recommended Best Practices Always thoroughly inspect a battery before charging and use. Look for swelling, puffy cells, cracks in plastic, and charred debris along the contacts. Never use a battery that is not in good health. Consider batteries to be replaceable and consumable, rather than a permanent component of the UAS. Never store batteries in a hot car. Don’t charge your batteries unless you’re going to fly within the next day. After immediate use, place battery out of the sun but do not place within a closed container. Ensure there is sufficient airflow to allow the battery to cool. When done flying for the day, always charge your batteries at least back up to storage level. Do not charge an intelligent flight battery immediately after flight as the temperature may be too high. Wait until it cools down to room temperature before charging again. Store the battery in a dry and cool place, keep out of direct sunlight and away from any liquids Do not store or transport a battery with eyeglasses, watches, metal necklaces or other metal components that may short the battery When in transport, store the batteries in a safe container that will protect it from damage, squeezing, puncturing or falling. 12.2 Planning for Fire Mitigation In addition to LiPo battery care, special effort must be taken to consider the fire risks in UAS activity. Consult the appropriate department (Fire, Field Safety, EH&amp;S) if there are concerns over fire risk. Minimize the potential for fire by monitoring where the UAS will be flying and ensure that if a fire was to occur, the RPIC and any other persons, such as Visual Observers, are prepared to respond appropriately. Guidance for fire safety Everyone should take a fire safety training course. Avoid flying on high fire risk days, including Red Flag Warning alerts issued by CAL FIRE. Never fly alone in areas of moderate to high fire risk Always bring a fire extinguisher and a shovel/bucket of sand to field sites. During flight operations: Ensure that a crew member has easy access to fire equipment. Ensure that a crew member has easy access to reach any location where the unmanned aircraft may crash. Ensure that a crew member has the ability to report an emergency situation and can adequately provide directions for emergency personnel to reach the site. When flying in high fire risk locations, use high quality, commercially available unmanned aircraft with enclosed electronics. Never fly a damaged or swollen battery.
